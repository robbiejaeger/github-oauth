# GitHub OAuth Practice

This is a practice exercise in implementing OAuth 2.0 using [GitHub's OAuth strategy](https://developer.github.com/apps/building-oauth-apps/authorizing-oauth-apps/).

By no means is this completely secure, but more just an experiment in getting OAuth tokens from scratch.

In the future, I'm looking to implement sessions using a cookie.
